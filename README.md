### 📖 Background:
- This dataset represents **real operational data** from a **mid-sized Vietnamese commercial bank** during the high-growth period **2023–2025** — a time when Vietnamese banks aggressively expanded both funding and lending amid rising interest rates and stricter SBV regulations.
- The bank operates **68 branches/POS** across all 8 economic regions, serving **540+ customers** (retail + SME + corporate), with:
  - Over **38,000 CASA transactions**
  - More than **426 active credit contracts** (total outstanding ~VND 2.5 trillion)
  - Full regulatory classifications: credit purpose (per Circular 41/2021), economic sector (QĐ 27/2018), collateral type, customer segment
- However, like many Vietnamese banks at that time, the bank was facing critical operational challenges:
  - **CASA ratio stuck below 25%** while competitors aggressively pushed digital onboarding
  - **Rapid credit growth** but heavy exposure to real-estate-related lending → increasing regulatory scrutiny
  - **Data scattered across 20+ CSV files** maintained by different departments → no single source of truth
  - **Relationship managers had no tool** to quickly spot cross-sell opportunities or monitor VIP client health
### 📚 Business Problem  
Leadership and business units face four critical challenges that require accurate, real-time answers:

1. **Slow deposit growth & high cost of funds**  
   → Low CASA ratio, heavy reliance on long-term fixed deposits → NIM under pressure  
   → No visibility into which branches/regions/products drive CASA performance

2. **Credit growth quality not fully controlled**  
   → Loan book grows fast, but structure is unclear: How much is real-estate business lending? Consumer? Securities? Unsecured?  
   → Concentration risk by industry, purpose, and collateral type is not proactively monitored

3. **No single source of truth across the bank**  
   → Each department uses separate Excel files → numbers differ 5-10% in management meetings  
   → Lack of an interactive enterprise-wide dashboard with drill-down capability

4. **Limited cross-sell and VIP customer management**  
   → Relationship managers cannot instantly identify high-potential customers  
   → Missing a true Customer 360° view for targeted offers and retention

5. **Credit & Risk**  
- Full loan portfolio breakdown by regulatory purpose, industry (QĐ 27), collateral type  
- **Customer segmentation** (Retail, SME, Corporate, VIP, Priority)  
- **Debt group classification** (Nhóm 1–5 according to Circular 02/2017 & 11/2021)  
- **Overdue payment analysis** – late payment amounts, number of overdue days, overdue customers  
- Aging report & early warning signals  

6. **Profitability**  
- **Weighted average lending rate** (lãi suất cho vay bình quân)  
- Net Interest Margin (NIM) calculation & trend  
- Interest income/expense forecasting

###🎯 Project Objective  
Build **one unified Banking Operations Dashboard** that instantly answers the most critical questions:

- How much new funding was mobilized today/last month? How is CASA trending?
- Current loan portfolio size and breakdown by regulatory purpose & industry
- Which branches/regions deliver the best CASA and highest-quality lending?
- Top cross-sell opportunities (high deposits + no loans | high loans + low CASA)
- Real NIM performance and trend over time

**Dataset**: 540+ customers • 426 credit contracts • 38,000+ CASA transactions • Full branch network & regulatory classifications
